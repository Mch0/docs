There are a few ways of upgrading the PrestaShop store. This chapter provides information about two methods of getting the software to the latest version.

## Upgrade assistant module (formerly 1-click upgrade module)

You can use provided `autoupgrade` module to upgrade your store to the newest version using web interface. You can read more about the module and how to use it [here]({{< ref "/8/basics/keeping-up-to-date/use-autoupgrade-module" >}}).

## Upgrade assistant module (formerly 1-click upgrade module) - CLI method

Upgrade assistant module (autoupgrade) is fully accessible through `cli`. You can read all the details [here]({{< ref "/8/basics/keeping-up-to-date/upgrade-module/upgrade-cli" >}}).

## Support service

Doing an upgrade by yourself can be risky. If you feel uncomfortable with doing it on your own, you can find support on [prestashop-project.org](https://www.prestashop-project.org/support/).

Basically, the process and the result will be the same. The existing data on the shop will be kept, as well as your module and your current theme.

Many agencies and freelancers in your area may also provide this kind of service.
